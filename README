NAME
    Reindeer - Moose with more antlers

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        # ta-da!
        use Reindeer;

DESCRIPTION
    Like Moose? Use MooseX::* extensions? Maybe some MooseX::Types
    libraries? Hate that you have to use them in every. Single. Class.

    Reindeer aims to resolve that :) Reindeer _is_ Moose -- it's just Moose
    with a number of the more useful/popular extensions already applied.
    Reindeer is a drop-in replacement for your "use Moose" line, that
    behaves in the exact same way... Just with more pointy antlers.

INCLUDED EXTENSIONS
    Reindeer includes the traits and sugar provided by the following
    extensions. Everything their docs say they can do, you can do by default
    with Reindeer.

  MooseX::AbstractMethod
  MooseX::AlwaysCoerce
  MooseX::AttributeShortcuts
  MooseX::MarkAsMethods
    Note that this causes any overloads you've defined in your class/role to
    be marked as methods, and namespace::autoclean invoked.

  MooseX::NewDefaults
  MooseX::StrictConstructor
INCLUDED TYPE LIBRARIES
  MooseX::Types::Moose
  MooseX::Types::Common::String
  MooseX::Types::Common::Numeric
OTHER
    Non-Moose specific items made available to your class/role:

  Try::Tiny
CAVEAT
    This author is applying his own assessment of "useful/popular
    extensions". You may find yourself in agreement, or violent disagreement
    with his choices. YMMV :)
