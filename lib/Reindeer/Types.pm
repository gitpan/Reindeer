=head1 NAME

Reindeer::Types - Reindeer combined type library

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.017 of Reindeer::Types - released March 03, 2014 as part of Reindeer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    use Moose;
    use Reindeer::Types ':all';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a combined type library, allowing for the quick and easy import of all
the type libraries L<Reindeer> provides by default.  Its primary goal is to
make the types easily available even when using Reindeer isn't an option.

It is not necessary (or prudent) to directly use this in a Reindeer class (or
role).

=head1 TYPES

=head2 C<LoadableClass>

A normal class / package.

=head2 C<LoadableRole>

Like C<LoadableClass>, except the loaded package must be a L<Moose::Role>.

=head2 C<SimpleStr>

A C<Str> with no new-line characters.

=head2 C<NonEmptySimpleStr>

A C<Str> with no new-line characters and length > 0

=head2 C<LowerCaseSimpleStr>

A C<Str> with no new-line characters, length > 0 and no uppercase characters
A coercion exists via C<lc> from C<NonEmptySimpleStr>

=head2 C<UpperCaseSimpleStr>

A C<Str> with no new-line characters, length > 0 and no lowercase characters
A coercion exists via C<uc> from C<NonEmptySimpleStr>

=head2 C<Password>

=head2 C<StrongPassword>

=head2 C<NonEmptyStr>

A C<Str> with length > 0

=head2 C<LowerCaseStr>

A C<Str> with length > 0 and no uppercase characters.
A coercion exists via C<lc> from C<NonEmptyStr>

=head2 C<UpperCaseStr>

A C<Str> with length > 0 and no lowercase characters.
A coercion exists via C<uc> from C<NonEmptyStr>

=head2 C<NumericCode>

A C<Str> with no new-line characters that consists of only Numeric characters.
Examples include, Social Security Numbers, Personal Identification Numbers, Postal Codes, HTTP Status
Codes, etc. Supports attempting to coerce from a string that has punctuation
in it ( e.g credit card number 4111-1111-1111-1111 ).

=head2 C<PositiveNum>

=head2 C<PositiveOrZeroNum>

=head2 C<PositiveInt>

=head2 C<PositiveOrZeroInt>

=head2 C<NegativeNum>

=head2 C<NegativeOrZeroNum>

=head2 C<NegativeInt>

=head2 C<NegativeOrZeroInt>

=head2 C<SingleDigit>

=head2 IxHash

Base type: TiedHash

This type coerces from ArrayRef.  As of 0.004 we no longer coerce from
HashRef, as that lead to 1) annoyingly easy to miss errors involving expecting
C<$thing->attribute( { a => 1, b => 2, ... } )> to result in proper ordering;
and 2) the Hash native trait appearing to work normally but instead silently
destroying the preserved order (during certain write operations).

(See also L<MooseX::Types::Tied::Hash::IxHash>.)

=head2 Dir

    has 'dir' => (
        is       => 'ro',
        isa      => Dir,
        required => 1,
        coerce   => 1,
    );

(See also L<MooseX::Types::Path::Class>.)

=head2 File

    has 'file' => (
        is       => 'ro',
        isa      => File,
        required => 1,
        coerce   => 1,
    );

(See also L<MooseX::Types::Path::Class>.)

=head2 MooseX::Types::Moose

We provide all Moose native types by including L<MooseX::Types::Moose>; see
that package for more information.
