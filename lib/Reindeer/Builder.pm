=head1 NAME

Reindeer::Builder - Easily build a new 'Reindeer' style class

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.017 of Reindeer::Builder - released March 03, 2014 as part of Reindeer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Reindeer;
    use Reindeer::Builder
        also => {
            exclude => [ ... ], # packages from also
            add     => [ ... ],
        };

    package My::Class;
    use My::Reindeer;

    # profit!
    has foo => (...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you need more than what L<Reindeer> provides...  And sometime less.
Or there's a conflict with a default extension (e.g. a Catalyst controller
with a config that will end up with unrecognized arguments passed to the
constructor will blow up if L<MooseX::StrictConstructor> is used).

Reindeer::Builder provides a simple interface to add additional extensions --
or filter the list of default extensions.  It's intended to be used in a
package of its own that can then be used in the same way L<Moose> or
L<Reindeer> is in a package, to set up the metaclass and sugar.

=head1 ROLE OR CLASS?

If the package you're using Reindeer::Builder in ends with '::Role', we set up
role metaclass and sugar.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

We take a set of name / hashref pairs.  Right now we only support 'also' for
names.

It is legal and supported to add and exclude at the same time.

=head2 also / exclude

If given, we expect exclude to be an arrayref of package names to be excluded
from the list of extensions.  (e.g. this filters what is passed to
L<Moose::Exporter>'s 'also' argument.

e.g.

    use Reindeer::Builder also => { exclude => 'MooseX::Something' };

=head2 also / add

If given, we expect add to be an arrayref of package names to be added
to the list of extensions.  (e.g. this augments what is passed to
L<Moose::Exporter>'s 'also' argument.

e.g.

    use Reindeer::Builder also => { add => 'MooseX::SomethingElse' };
